# directionalhud
Want N / E / S / W directional compass HUD above the player? Here I have put together a stand-alone resource pack directional HUD renderer that is above the players screen for easy navigation.


### Features:
> - Easy apply & instantly working.
> - Compatible with most addons.
> - Lightweight, no constant code running.
> - No back door & no obfuscation, created by ARAS Staff (me).
> - Doesn't require behavior pack.

### Notices:
> - __May__ conflict with addons such as: Lifesteal, Scoreboards, and anything that may override the player's HUD screen.
> - Minecraft had before broken addons like these in updates, it's possible, but super rare.

Simply download the mcpack file and apply it to your world/realm!
